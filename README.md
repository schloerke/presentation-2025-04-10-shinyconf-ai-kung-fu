## Abstract

Teaching an AI how to use your newly developed Python package can be challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating code but lack the knowledge to interact seamlessly with every existing package. In this talk, I'll demonstrate how to create a comprehensive system prompt for your Python package using just two function calls. This generated prompt guides the LLM on how to interact with your specific package and only requires a few manual instructions. To illustrate the efficacy of this approach, we'll integrate the generated prompt into the 'chatlas' Python package and engage in a live chat with the LLM.
